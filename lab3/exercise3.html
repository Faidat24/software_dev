    <h2 id="#train">Back on the Anime Train</h2>
    <p>I've always been a fan of anime, but with how hectic life's been lately, I kinda fell off the bandwagon. Lately though, I've been easing back into it and I figured it'd be fun to share a few of the shows that are keeping me entertained right now. This isn't some big definitive list of what's trending or "the best." It's just a quick snapshot of what's been hitting the spot for me and what I plan to watch soon.</p>
    <h2 id="#now">Now Playing</h2>
    <p>These are the anime series I'm currently immersed in. If any catch your eye, feel free to check them out on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll.</a></p>
